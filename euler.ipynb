      "source": "To understand why this works, let's explain what's going on in the code.\n\nIn the very first line, we import **comb** from the **math** module. \"comb\" is simply a function that calculates the number of ways to choose *k* items from *n* items, without repetition and without order. We call this function in the format of `comb(n, k)`.\n\nThe next line is our function definition, where we essentially pass information about the problem into \"parameters,\" which are then used to solve the problem. The text enclosed with three quotation marks are known as \"comments,\" and they describe what each parameter is being used for.\n\nNow, we come across a variable named `prob_not_picking_color`. This variable, as the name implies, stores the probability of not picking a ball with a certain color. \n\nTo find the probability of not picking a ball of a specific color, we apply two instances of the **comb** function: in the first, we let *k* equal the total number of balls minus the number of balls of each color, and *n* is simply the number of balls to pick. In the second instance, we let *k* equal the total number of balls, and *n* equal the number of balls to pick. \n\nDividing these values gives us the probability of not picking a ball of a certain color. If the reason as to why this is the case is still unclear, think of it this way: there are 70 colored balls- 10 for each color- and we're picking 20 balls. Say for all 20 balls we pick, none of them end up being red. What is the probability of this happening? In other words, how many different ways can we choose 20 balls such that none of them are red? \n\nThat is what the first instance of the **comb** function is calculating. If none of the balls we pick are allowed to be red, then we would have to subtract the 10 red balls from the 70 total balls in the urn. Thus, the function would be `comb(70 - 10, 20)`- in other words, the number of ways to choose *k* (20) balls from *n* (60) balls.\n\nThe second instance of **comb** simply calculates the number of ways to choose 20 balls from all 70 of the total balls- in other words, no color restriction. If we expand out the functions, we can see that the actual values being divided are `4191844505805495 / 161884603662657876`, which is equivalent to saying there is an approximately `2.5894%` chance that, if we pick 20 balls from the urn of 70 balls, none of them will be of a certain color. \n\nThe next variable is a lot more straight forward: `prob_picking_color`. This is simply equal to `1 - prob_not_picking_color`, or in other words, the probability that, if we pick 20 balls from the urn of 70 balls, we will have at least 1 ball from every color pool.\n\nNow that we've made these calculations, we can multiply the number of distinct colors by `prob_picking_color` to give us the expected number of distinct colors. And that's it!",
